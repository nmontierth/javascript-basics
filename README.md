# javascriptBasics
This repository is devoted towards storing my interpretations of basic JS principles. Note: not all code written within this repository will be executable-- some portions will be used to form analogies between JS concepts and the real world.

Some content will be copied from the third edition of Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke. I do not own this content and it will be marked by **EJ**.
